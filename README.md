# Hi, I'm Mo 👋

I work at [Degreed](http://degreed.com/) as a front-end developer during the day, and At night I build software to help others learn new tech. 

I am building [Mo Skool](https://moskool.com) with [@moskool](https://github.com/moskool) to help new developers learn React Js quickly and effectively.
